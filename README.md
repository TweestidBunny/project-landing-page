This project is to demonstrate the skills I have learned so far,
in order to create a mock-up landing page.

For now, I am going to stick with just creating the mock-up, and
am not going to insert any pictures, or make it look like a "real"
company landing page. Later, I may come back to edit this, but
I think it would be better to leave this as an initial practice/demo
and later create a new, more professional looking landing page, so
I can go back and compare the two, to see how far I've gone.

For this project, I will be making a basic mock-up, then making
it look good using CSS. Mostly, using Flexbox for the design
layout, then of course some background and font colors, font sizes,
etc.

Although I will be making the entire page from scratch, I will be
essentially copying the example given from:
